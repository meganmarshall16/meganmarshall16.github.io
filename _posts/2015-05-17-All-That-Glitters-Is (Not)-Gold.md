A while ago, Apple announced a new line of MacBooks adorned with silver, gold, and space grey colours. While I have yet to sit down and try it out, online reviews across the web have spoken of its issues - namely the USB C port and all it’s dongles. The new MacBook improves itself with it’s butterfly key mechanism, Force Touch trackpad, fanless interior, and 236 ppi, 2304 x 1440 pixels Retina display (although you do have the option to use 1440 x 900 pixel display). It’s processor is built for basic computing that isn’t too heavy on the CPU usage.

Now, with all its improvements, I still don’t think the new MacBook is my cup of tea. Reviewers are quick to comment that the new computer is built for basic on-the-go computing and not to be used as your main computer. It seems to me to be the equivalent of what you would use an iPad for. Although the USB C port is not very convenient, there has been a shift towards more wireless file storage and online streaming. Maybe the new USB C port is exactly what we need: in the future. However, for the time being, the MacBook is a beautiful addition to the Macintosh family.
