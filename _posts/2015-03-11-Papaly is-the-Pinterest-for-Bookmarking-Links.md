Here at TechMarks, we can’t get enough of bookmarks. In addition to saving all my links to Pocket, Evernote, Instapaper, and Safari Reading List, I also have countless folders of bookmarks. While I tried to muster up all my strength into not using another bookmarking service, what appealed to me about [**Papaly**](https://papaly.com) was it’s minimalist design and easy organization of links into different categories.

Papaly allows you to give your board a name, create new categories, and organize your bookmarks into these categories. When you start a new board, Papaly gives you the option to choose from an existing popular category of bookmarks, import your own bookmarks, or start from scratch altogether. You are also given the option to make a board public or private, invisible to Google, specify number of columns, and select how the categories and links are organized by.

Overall I found the service to be quite refreshing and I managed to clean out my bookmarks from my other existing services and folders. Check it out and let me know your thoughts in the comments below!
