I feel the best way to start the new year is to say goodbye to the old one. Here is this year’s most loved products apps that I could not have lived without.

**Medium** - best reading platform. I cannot explain how many countless articles and gems I find on this site. And prior to 2014, I had no idea this site existed! A daily routine has been browsing the top reads and saving them to Pocket. So much insight has been gained from articles written by completely different people.

**Udemy** - I actually forced myself to learn something new this year! A great platform for learning new things. If only it didn’t suck up my monthly internet bandwidth!

**Evernote** - I always wondered what the big craze was over this service. But I use it as a database to store all my most important articles I come across. It still feels like I’m missing something though (I heard the real deal was in the tags).

**Feedly** - My old job introduced me into the world of RSS this year. Feedly has helped me learn the ropes. While I try not to make it too heavy, all my news and information comes from the sites whose RSS I subscribe to.

**Spotify** and **Google Play** - My music library is overflowing and taking up all my storage on all of my devices. Alas I have finally discovered the upsides to streaming. While I’m not ready to part with my music just yet and go for a premium subscription, I do enjoy the basic perks.

**Stache** - I’m all about bookmarking this year. This service helped me store my most important bookmarks while looking visually stunning too!

**IFTTT, Tasker, Hazel, Textexpander, Workflow, Keyboard Maestro,** and **Alfred** - Automation is king! I’ve fallen in love with automation and anything that makes my life easier. These guys basically run my life for me and I love them for it.

**Sketch** - Lightweight and simple. I can literally feel the stress leaving my system. An essential app for the designer alike.

**Boxer** - While I try to come to terms with Airmail 2.0, I have Boxer on my iPad and phone to make email less cluttered (though I’m nowhere near inbox zero!). I am interested to see how Google Inbox will play into the mix.

**Product Hunt** - This site use to completely confuse me with it’s simplicity. Now it’s my favourite part! An excellent site to gather new products of interest.
